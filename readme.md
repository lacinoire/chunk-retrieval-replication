# How to Analyze Build Logs - A Comparative Study of Chunk Retrieval Techniques

Welcome to our replication package! ðŸ˜Š

Here you'll find the implementations of the four chunk retrieval techniques we
compared:
- [program synthesis by example using Microsoft's PROSE library (PBE)](pbe-extraction-buildlogs)
- [common text similarity (CTS)](r-extractions)
- [keyword search (KWS)](r-extractions)
- [random line retrieval (RLR)](r-extractions)

If you want to execute them for specific examples only, check out our [unification tool](tool)!

If you want to replicate our empirical study keep reading :)

In the [`tool`](tool) folder we keep a modified (adapted folder & xml structure) version of the [LogChunks data set](https://zenodo.org/record/3632351).
We provide Docker files that have the unification tool configured for the evaluation of each of the four techniques.
When executing them we bind-mount this folder, the results are then written out to `evaluation/results`.

## Runtimes

We executed our evaluation on a server with these specs: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHz.

The rough runtimes were:  
PBE: 19 h  
CTS: 15 min  
KWS: 25 min  
RLR: 5 min  

<details>
  <summary> <b>Run Evaluation of PBE</b> </summary>

build (from within this folder):
``` bash
docker image build --network host -t pbe -f pbe-extraction-buildlogs/DockerfilePBE .
```
You can also pull a pre-built image from the docker repository [lacinoire/chunk-retrieval-replication-pbe](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lacinoire/chunk-retrieval-replication-pbe).

run (from within this folder):
``` bash
docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/chunk-retrieval-replication pbe
```

As program synthesis is not the fastest, this takes a whole while to complete (especially on a personal machine).
The results of evaluating each project in the data set are directly written out to the folder `evaluation/results`, so you can check them out even if the whole evaluation did not complete yet!

## Python Notebooks

The evaluation folder also contains the unified result files of our evaluation as well as the three python notebooks we used or analyzing the data in the results sub-folder.
